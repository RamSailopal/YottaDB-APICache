# YottaDB-APICache
A demonstration of using YottaDB as an API cache in a similar way to the way Redis is used

Redis in an in memory key value data store where as YottaDB is an on disk key value store. The speed of RAM against disk would therefore make Redis more performant but the native speed of YottaDB and the lower cost of disk space would make YottaDB beneficial none the less
